known problems:
* tables w/o two-line headers did not show the second row
* openmp p1 did not set the number of threads explicitly to max (and hence depended on the implementation to do so for -p 0)

openmp prefix sum:
WTF? :/

mpi prefix sum:
> What is the asymptotic running time of your algorithm as a function of n and p? Which assumptions do you need for the estimate?

T(local sum(n/p) + Exscan(p) + local add(n/p))
2n/p T(sum op) + n log(n) T(message transfer time of one ATYPE-equivalent)
